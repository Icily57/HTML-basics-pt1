What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: 
-->
<!-- Start tag     Element content	       End tag -->
     <h1>	       My First Heading	       </h1>
     <p>	       My first paragraph.	   </p>
     <br>	       (Empty element with no end tag)

<!--
Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):     
-->
    <!-- EXAMPLE:  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
Example Explained:
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <body> element contains the visible page content
Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>.
The <h1> and <p> elements are nested inside the <body> element
-->

<!-- 
Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
-->

<!-- 
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
However it is a good practice to use lowercase tag names.
